Sprites, sprites and more sprites 



//////////////////////////////////////////////
// What the hell even is this?             //
/////////////////////////////////////////////

This is a bunch of my icons i've worked on, most of which do not even have features yet, NOTE, i will not be sharing any icons that are for a coder IE active at the moment, or for another server without their permission to release said icons



////////////////////////////////////////
// What do i do with these?           //
////////////////////////////////////////

If you're a coder and you're seeing this, add them! that's what they're there for, this is really just so you can find neat DMIS and think of things to do with them



Enjoy, Kmc2000


////////////
// Usage //
///////////
You're absolutely free to use the sprites however, just make sure that you accredit me to them, i don't want any sprites stealing



//////////////
// Issues   //
//////////////

I haven't filtered most of these, so some of these may be temporary icons, if you find one make an issue so i can remove it
